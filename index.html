                <h3>About Gojo Satoru</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Appearence</strong><br>Satoru Gojo is a tall man, towering over his students, and is considered to be very attractive by many people. He has white hair that's often spiked up, but Gojo lets it down when he's in more casual attire. Gojo has bright blue eyes, but they're usually covered by his signature black blindfold or a pair of dark sunglasses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personality</strong><br>Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.
                    Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerfulsorcerer, believing himself to be invincible. His opinion of others often onlygo as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite apathetic towardsanyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire forpower, he is very arrogant. </li>
                    <li><strong>Powers</strong></li>Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, holding both immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique.

                    As a student, Satoru and Suguru were both considered "the strongest", capable of making short work of experienced and powerful curse users. After realizing and perfecting his capabilities, Satoru's abilities vastly increased to where he was able to put Toji Fushiguro into the defensive and ultimately kill him with his strongest technique, whereas before he and Geto were no match for the renowned Sorcerer Killer.
